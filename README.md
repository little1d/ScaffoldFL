# Federated Learning (Scaffold and Fedprox) using PyTorch
**Implementation of:**
**Fedprox:**  [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06378](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06127)
**Scaffold:** [SCAFFOLD: Stochastic Controlled Averaging for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06127)

Models: VGG, CNN
DataSet: Cifar10
















##### Note
Non-iid implementation and dataset used is different in Scaffold Paper.

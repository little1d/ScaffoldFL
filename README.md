# Federated Learning (Scaffold and Fedprox) using PyTorch
**Basic Implementation of:** <br>
**Fedprox:**  [Federated Optimization in Heterogeneous Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06127) <br>
**Scaffold:** [SCAFFOLD: Stochastic Controlled Averaging for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06378)<br>

Models: VGG, CNN <br>
DataSet: Cifar10

### Note
Non-iid implementation and dataset used is differ from the Scaffold Paper. <br>
